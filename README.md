# Snake-Game
I created the standard  snake game using python which can be runned on windows as well as android. It's a snake game where a player controls a snake to eat food  and it grows in length. The game has different functionalities such as displaying the score, high score, and a game over message.
# Instructions

use arrows to move left, right , up and down in the screen and eat the food.
Dont bite yourself or hit yourself to the wall or your game will be over.
                            Happy Playing
